# Repository for EPUB 3 Reading Systems bugs

This is a repo dedicated to collecting and maintaining the status of bugs found on EPUB reading systems. Bugs may pertain to display, accessibility, and other issues.

We hope that this repo will become an open dialog between content creators, content converters, software developers and reading system developers to better understand what is not working and what is expected for EPUBs in the wild. Content creators are welcome to note issues they uncover and workarounds they might find useful until fixes are in place. Reading system developers are welcome to share issues that they are working to resolve or to note that issues are being considered for resolution.
